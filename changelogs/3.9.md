**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.12.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.9.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.12.0
- Removed compatibility with 1.11.0

## Protocol
- The following classes in the `\pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol` namespace have been renamed:
  - `AddEntityPacket` -> `AddActorPacket`
  - `AddItemEntityPacket` -> `AddItemActorPacket`
  - `AvailableEntityIdentifiersPacket` -> `AvailableActorIdentifiersPacket`
  - `BlockEntityDataPacket` -> `BlockActorDataPacket`
  - `EntityEventPacket` -> `ActorEventPacket`
  - `EntityFallPacket` -> `ActorFallPacket`
  - `EntityPickRequestPacket` -> `ActorPickRequestPacket`
  - `MoveEntityAbsolutePacket` -> `MoveActorAbsolutePacket`
  - `MoveEntityDeltaPacket` -> `MoveActorDeltaPacket`
  - `RemoveEntityPacket` -> `RemoveActorPacket`
  - `SetEntityDataPacket` -> `SetActorDataPacket`
  - `SetEntityLinkPacket` -> `SetActorLinkPacket`
  - `SetEntityMotionPacket` -> `SetActorMotionPacket`
  - `TakeItemEntityPacket` -> `TakeItemActorPacket`
- The following classes in the `\pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol` namespace have been removed:
  - `FullChunkDataPacket`
- The following classes in the `\pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol` namespace have been added:
  - `AddEntityPacket` (not to be confused with the old one)
  - `ClientCacheBlobStatusPacket`
  - `ClientCacheMissResponsePacket`
  - `ClientCacheStatusPacket`
  - `LevelChunkPacket`
  - `RemoveEntityPacket` (not to be confused with the old one)
  - `StructureTemplateDataExportRequestPacket`
  - `StructureTemplateDataExportResponsePacket`

# 3.9.1
- Fixed resource packs not working on 1.12 clients.
- Fixed some particles displaying incorrectly (some still don't render at all).
- Fixed `Entity->setFireTicks()` with a value of `0` setting the on-fire flag.
- Silenced a debug message which appeared every time a player right-clicked a block.
- Updated constants for `LevelSoundEventPacket`.

# 3.9.2
- Logger warnings for illegal player movements have been lowered to debug.
- TNT explosions now start from the center instead of the base. This fixes unexpected results when TNT is lit on top of obsidian.
- Fixed the `loadbefore` directive in `plugin.yml` sometimes being ignored.
- Fixed `Item->setCustomName()` with an empty string leaving behind an empty tag.
- Fixed incorrect positioning of bucket empty sound.
- Fixed some incorrect tag parsing in `/give` involving quoted numbers.

# 3.9.3
- Fixed a memory leak on async task removal in error conditions.
- Fixed scheduled block updates (for example liquid) triggering chunk reloading. This could cause a significant performance issue in some conditions.
- Fixed some minor cosmetic issues in documentation.

# 3.9.4
- Fixed a memory leak when scheduled updates were pending on a chunk being unloaded.
- Fixed plugin detection in crashdumps. Previously `src/pocketmine` anywhere in the path would cause the error to be considered a core crash, regardless of the preceding path.
- Fixed entity metadata types for 1.12. The SLOT type was removed and a COMPOUND_TAG type added. This change involves changes to internal API which may break plugins. **See the warning at the top of this changelog about API versioning.**
- Fixed random and base populator amounts of trees and tallgrass never being initialized. This bug had no obvious effect, but may have become a problem in future PHP versions.
- The following internal methods have been marked as `@deprecated` and documentation warnings added:
  - `Entity->getBlocksAround()`
  - `Entity->despawnFrom()`
  - `Entity->despawnFromAll()`
- Fixed plugin `softdepend` not influencing load order when a soft-depended plugin had an unresolved soft dependency of its own.
- Fixed endless falling of sand on top of fences.
